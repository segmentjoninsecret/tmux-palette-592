## QUICK START

```bash
git clone https://github.com/segmentjoninsecret/tmux-palette-592.git
cd tmux-palette-592
npm install
npm start
```


A command palette for tmux. It runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh), has no runtime
dependencies, and opens quickly enough to use as a regular tmux binding.

Type a few letters, pick a command, hit enter: split a pane, jump to a window,
detach a session, open a popup tool, or switch to a custom palette. User config
lives in `~/.config/tmux-palette/*.json`, so local changes survive repo updates.

**Commands** — main palette for panes, windows, sessions, and built-in tmux actions.

**Themes + plugins** — theme picker with live preview, plus custom palettes powered by shell commands.

## Status

The tool is in beta. It's stable enough to use day-to-day, but the surface area
is still settling — I want the next few weeks to be about running it myself,
gathering feedback, and shaking out bugs rather than growing the feature set.

If you'd like to contribute, the most useful work right now is anything that
improves the existing base (refactors, perf, polish, docs) or fixes a bug. New
features will likely get closed — no hard feelings, but please open an issue
first to discuss before writing code.

## Highlights

- **Fast startup** — designed for frequent use from a tmux key binding
- **Custom palettes** — define your own with [a single JSON file](#custom-palettes), bind to any key
- **Hide built-ins** — declutter the default palette via [`hidden.json`](#hiddenjson--hide-built-in-items)
- **Mobile-aware** — [auto-fullscreens](#sizingjson--popup-dimensions-and-borders) on narrow terminals (Moshi / Blink on iOS)
- **Curated themes** — 12 built-in themes including Shades of Purple, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord, and Solarized. [Pick one with live preview](#themes), or [drop your own](#custom-themes)
- **Popup tools** — use `{ "popup": "htop" }` to open tools like `btop`, `lazygit`, log tails, or `fzf` scripts in a tmux popup
- **Scriptable sources** — point a palette at a shell command that prints JSON or one item per line. Examples live in [`examples/`](examples)
- **Small codebase** — roughly 2k LOC, so it is easy to audit, fork, or patch locally
- **No fork required** — every customization lives in `~/.config/tmux-palette/*.json`

## What you can build

- Open `lazygit`, `htop`, `btop`, or log tails in a centered tmux popup.
- Create a PR explorer from `gh pr list` that opens PRs in your browser.
- Create a GitHub Actions picker that jumps straight to a workflow run.
- Pick a Docker container and tail its logs in a popup.
- List npm scripts from the current project and run one from tmux.
- Bind focused palettes to separate keys, like `M-t` for Tools or `M-a` for Appearance.
- Keep a personal favorites palette without editing the repo.

See [`examples/`](examples) for drop-in palettes you can copy into
`~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/`.


### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- tmux 3.4+ recommended (`display-popup -E` support)
- Optional tools for examples only: `gh`, `jq`, `docker`, `npm`, `git`, etc.

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install</b></summary>

<br/>

Requires Bun: https://bun.sh

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduwass/tmux-palette ~/Sites/tmux-palette
cd ~/Sites/tmux-palette
bun install
```

Bind it to a tmux key in your `.tmux.conf` — `Ctrl+Space` gives the most "Raycast-feel" since it skips the prefix:

```tmux
bind -n C-Space run-shell "~/Sites/tmux-palette/bin/tmux-palette.sh"
```

Or if you'd rather go through the tmux prefix:

```tmux
bind p run-shell "~/Sites/tmux-palette/bin/tmux-palette.sh"
```

Reload: `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` and hit your binding.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install via TPM</b> (Tmux Plugin Manager)</summary>

<br/>

Requires Bun: https://bun.sh

Add to your `.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'eduwass/tmux-palette'
set -g @palette-key 'C-Space'             # optional, default: C-Space (no-prefix)
set -g @palette-find-pane-key 'M-f'       # optional, no binding by default
set -g @palette-move-pane-key 'M-m'       # optional, no binding by default
```

Then `prefix + I` (TPM's install key) to install. TPM clones the repo,
runs `bun install` on first load, and binds the keys for you. Set
`@palette-key 'off'` to skip the main binding and bind it yourself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Guided onboarding with an AI agent</b></summary>

<br/>

This is optional; it is just a guided setup flow. Choose it if you want an
agent to drive the onboarding experience: install the repo, set up the tmux
binding, test that it opens, and optionally create your first custom commands
or theme.

Paste the prompt below into [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [opencode](https://opencode.ai), Cursor, or any AI coding agent.

You are helping a user onboard tmux-palette, a small command palette for tmux. Repo: https://github.com/eduwass/tmux-palette

Goal: get the palette installed, bound to a key, tested inside tmux, and leave the user with one useful next customization if they want it.

Follow steps in order. Confirm with the user before any change that modifies their files.

- Run `bun --version`. If Bun is missing, point them to https://bun.sh/docs/installation and stop — do not auto-install.
- Run `tmux -V`. If lower than 3.4, warn that `display-popup -E` may not work, then proceed.

- Default path: `~/Sites/tmux-palette`. Ask the user if they want a different location.
- If the path already exists and contains the repo, run `git -C <path> pull` and skip cloning.
- Otherwise: `git clone https://github.com/eduwass/tmux-palette <path> && cd <path> && bun install`.

- Default suggestion: `bind -n C-Space run-shell "<absolute-path>/bin/tmux-palette.sh"` (no-prefix, opens with Ctrl+Space). Ask the user if they want a different key.
- Append the bind line to `~/.tmux.conf` (create it if missing).
- Run `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` to reload (or tell them to do it).

Ask: "Want to choose a built-in theme now, or should I try to match your terminal's theme?"

If they want a built-in theme:
- Tell them they can open the palette and choose **Switch Theme...** for live preview.
- Mention the curated built-ins: Shades of Purple, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin Mocha, Gruvbox Dark, Rosé Pine, Nord, Solarized Dark, Kanagawa Wave, GitHub Dark, One Dark, Ayu Dark.

If they want to match their terminal, detect it:
- Check $TERM_PROGRAM and $TERM. Common values: ghostty, iTerm.app, vscode, WezTerm, Apple_Terminal.
- Read the relevant config:
  - Ghostty:    ~/.config/ghostty/config
  - Alacritty:  ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml (or .yml)
  - Kitty:      ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf  (follow `include` lines)
  - WezTerm:    ~/.wezterm.lua or ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua
  - iTerm2 / others: ask the user for hex codes; their configs are hard to parse.
- Extract: background → `bg`, foreground → `fg`, cursor color → `accent`, selection bg → `selected`. Derive `panel` (slightly lighter than bg) and `muted` (fg dimmed).
- Write `~/.config/tmux-palette/theme.json` with `{ bg, panel, selected, fg, muted, accent }`. The palette reads this at runtime; do NOT edit source files.
- Report the colors you picked.

Tell the user to press their binding. Ask what they see.

When it works, ask:
- "Want a quick custom command, like opening lazygit or htop in a popup?" — write items to `~/.config/tmux-palette/commands.json` (array of Items). Action types: `{ "tmux": "..." }`, `{ "shell": "..." }`, `{ "popup": "..." }`, `{ "palette": "name" }`. Do NOT edit source files.
- "Want a focused palette for PRs, Docker logs, npm scripts, or git branches?" — copy an example from `examples/` into `~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/` and bind it.
- "Want custom shortcut labels?" — write `~/.config/tmux-palette/shortcuts.json` mapping item titles to label strings.

Only do one follow-up unless the user asks for more.

Constraints
- Prefer `~/.config/tmux-palette/*.json` over source edits. The user's config survives upstream pulls; source edits don't.
- Do not push to git or modify files outside the user's home directory.
- Do not auto-install Bun or any other system package.
- If anything fails, stop and explain what went wrong.

## Trust And Safety

- CI runs `bun test`, TypeScript, Fallow dead-code, and Fallow duplication checks.
- The codebase is intentionally small and has no runtime package dependencies.
- Custom palettes are local JSON files, but they can run shell commands. Only copy
  palette examples you understand, especially if they come from outside this repo.
- User config lives under `~/.config/tmux-palette/`; normal customization should not
  require editing source files.

## Known Limitations

- Requires tmux popup support; tmux 3.4+ is recommended.
- Plugin commands run each time their palette opens. Add your own cache layer for
  slow commands.
- This is currently installed from the repo or via TPM, not a packaged npm release.
- `{ "shell": "..." }` and `{ "popup": "..." }` actions execute through the user's
  shell by design.

## Customize

Drop-in user config lives in `~/.config/tmux-palette/`. One JSON file per
concern — no source edits, no fork, survives upstream pulls.

### Custom palettes

Path: `~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/<name>.json`

Define a brand-new palette and bind any key to its name:

```tmux
bind -n M-q run-shell "~/Sites/tmux-palette/bin/tmux-palette.sh my-favs"
```

```jsonc
// ~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/my-favs.json
{
  "title": "Favorites",
  "from": ["Toggle Diff Viewer", "Find Pane", "Choose Session"],
  "fromCategory": "Tools",
  "items": [
    {
      "icon": "",
      "title": "Custom item only in this palette",
      "action": { "tmux": "run-shell '~/scripts/x.sh'" }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `from` — array of item titles to pull from the main commands palette (built-ins + your `commands.json`)
- `fromCategory` — pull every item from one category
- `command` — shell command that prints a JSON array of `Item` objects to stdout (see [plugins](#plugins) below)
- `items` — brand-new items defined inline
- `title` / `grouped` / `emptyText` — same as built-in palettes

All keys optional. Resolution order: `from` → `fromCategory` → `command` → `items`.

#### Plugins

> Drop-in ready-to-use palettes live in [`examples/`](examples) — git branches,
> GitHub PRs (with color-coded status dots), Docker container logs,
> npm scripts, file picker. Copy one and bind a key.

The `command` field is the plugin escape hatch — fzf-style. Anything
that prints to stdout becomes a palette. Two output modes:

**JSON mode** — full control. Print a JSON array of `Item` objects:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/github-prs.json
{
  "title": "GitHub PRs",
  "command": "gh pr list --json number,title,url --jq '[.[] | {icon: \"\", title: ((.number|tostring) + \" \" + .title), action: {shell: (\"gh pr view \" + (.number|tostring) + \" --web\")}}]'"
}
```

**Plain-text mode** — fzf-style. Print one item per line, define a
default `action` template at the palette level with `{}` substituted
for the selected line:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/tmux-palette/palettes/git-branches.json
{
  "title": "Git Branches",
  "command": "git branch --format='%(refname:short)'",
  "action": { "tmux": "send-keys 'git checkout {}' Enter" }
}
```

This means most "command that prints lines" tools you'd pipe through
fzf can become tmux-palette palettes with no scripting — just the JSON
config and an action template.

Write the command in any language, distribute it however you want
(gist, repo, copy-paste). The plugin runs every time the palette opens
(no caching), so for expensive calls add your own cache layer. Errors
are surfaced as a single item in the palette so failures stay visible
without crashing the popup.

### `hidden.json` — hide built-in items

Drop a JSON array of item titles to skip them in the main commands
palette:

```json
["Toggle Status Bar", "Reload Config", "Toggle OpenTUI Top Bar"]
```

Items still appear if you reference them by title in a custom palette
(see above) — `hidden.json` is just about decluttering the default.

### `commands.json` — your own items

Append items to the `commands` palette without editing source:

```json
[
  {
    "icon": "",
    "title": "Toggle Diff Viewer",
    "category": "Tools",
    "action": { "tmux": "run-shell '/path/to/script.sh'" }
  },
  {
    "icon": "󱂬",
    "title": "Open Project in Cursor",
    "category": "Tools",
    "action": { "shell": "cursor /path/to/project" }
  },
  {
    "icon": "",
    "title": "htop",
    "category": "Tools",
    "action": { "popup": "htop" }
  }
]
```

Action types: `{ "tmux": "..." }`, `{ "shell": "..." }`, `{ "popup": "..." }`, `{ "palette": "find-pane" }`.

`{ "popup": "htop" }` opens the given command in a centered tmux popup
(80% × 80%, closes when the command exits). Handy for log viewers,
htop, btop, less, fzf-driven tools, etc.

### `sizing.json` — popup dimensions and borders

```json
{
  "maxHeight": 28,
  "width": 90,
  "padX": 3,
  "mobileWidth": 80,
  "border": "none",
  "popupBorder": "none"
}
```

All keys optional. `maxHeight` caps how tall the popup gets when you
have lots of commands. `width` is the fixed popup width. `padX` is the
horizontal padding inside the popup.

`mobileWidth` is the client-width threshold for auto-fullscreen mode:
when the terminal is narrower than this many columns (iOS terminals
like Blink or Moshi typically run 50-60 cols), the popup goes
edge-to-edge with `padX=1`. Defaults to 80, set to 0 to disable.

`border` is the main palette border, `popupBorder` is the border for
`{ "popup": "..." }` action popups. Both default to `none`. Accepted
values: `none`, `single`, `double`, `heavy`, `rounded`, `padded`,
`simple` — passed straight to `tmux display-popup -b`. `rounded` works
but its corner glyphs can leave small visual gaps against the
surrounding terminal, so it is not the default.

### Themes

Open the main palette and pick **Switch Theme...** (under *Appearance*).
Arrow-key through the list — every theme lives-previews instantly so you
see the colors apply before you commit. Enter saves it and returns you to
the previous palette with the new theme on; Esc cancels.

The theme picker also includes **Add custom theme...**, which opens this
README's custom-theme instructions in your default browser.

Bundled themes are intentionally limited to a small curated set: Shades of
Purple, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin Mocha, Gruvbox Dark, Rosé Pine, Nord,
Solarized Dark, Kanagawa Wave, GitHub Dark, One Dark, and Ayu Dark. Their
panel/selected/muted/accent colors are tuned for readable contrast. To tweak a
theme without editing the repo, add a custom theme file or override individual
colors in `theme.json`.

### `theme.json` — set the active theme

Two forms. Pick a bundled (or custom) theme by name:

```json
{ "name": "tokyo-night" }
```

Or full color override (applied on top of the resolved theme):

```json
{
  "bg": "#1a1b26",
  "panel": "#16161e",
  "selected": "#283457",
  "fg": "#c0caf5",
  "muted": "#565f89",
  "accent": "#7aa2f7"
}
```

The theme switcher writes the `{ "name": "..." }` form for you. You can
also mix: pick a name, then add individual keys to nudge specific colors.

### Custom themes

Drop one JSON file per theme into `~/.config/tmux-palette/themes/`:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/tmux-palette/themes/my-theme.json
{
  "bg": "#0d0f12",
  "panel": "#171a1f",
  "selected": "#2c3038",
  "fg": "#e6e8eb",
  "muted": "#7d8590",
  "accent": "#ff6b6b"
}
```

Custom themes show up in the **Switch Theme...** picker alongside the
bundled ones (tagged `custom`). The filename becomes the slug — drop
`my-theme.json` → reference it as `{ "name": "my-theme" }` in
`theme.json`, or just pick it from the switcher.

### Category hotkeys

Pass `--category=<name>` to open the main palette filtered to one
category, Raycast-favorites style:

```tmux
bind -n M-t run-shell "~/Sites/tmux-palette/bin/tmux-palette.sh commands --category=Tools"
bind -n M-a run-shell "~/Sites/tmux-palette/bin/tmux-palette.sh commands --category=Appearance"
```

The popup title auto-updates to the category name and the category
header gets hidden (since everything is the same category anyway).

### `shortcuts.json` — custom shortcut labels

When your terminal has a key-remap layer (Ghostty / iTerm2 / Karabiner) that
translates something like `Cmd+D` into a tmux binding, tmux only sees the
tmux side and doesn't know the original key. Use this to show what you
actually press:

```json
{
  "Split Horizontal": "Cmd+D",
  "Find Pane": "Cmd+Shift+P",
  "Choose Session": "Cmd+S"
}
```

Keys are item titles; values are whatever text you want on the right side.

### `aliases.json` — extra visible alias chips

```json
{
  "Split Horizontal": ["sh"],
  "Find Pane": ["fp"]
}
```

Auto-aliases (initials like `nw`) still work for free, invisibly.

## Extending (deeper)

For things JSON can't express — custom row rendering, dynamic item
generators, custom filter logic — edit the TS source. Items in
`src/palettes/commands.ts` have this shape:

```ts
{
  icon: "󰍉",              // any nerd-font glyph
  title: "Find Pane",
  description?: "...",    // optional, dimmed text after title
  shortcut?: "Cmd+Shift+P", // optional, right-aligned label
  category?: "Panes",     // optional, groups items under a header
  aliases?: ["fp"],       // optional, visible chip + searchable
  action: { tmux: "..." } // see Actions below
}
```

### Actions

```ts
{ tmux: "split-window -h" }     // runs `tmux <cmd>` after the popup closes
{ shell: "echo hi" }            // runs a shell command after the popup closes
{ popup: "htop" }               // opens cmd in a centered 80% tmux popup
{ palette: "find-pane" }        // chains into another palette
{ run: (ctx) => { ... } }       // custom JS, runs in-process, then exits
{ apply: (ctx) => { ... } }     // custom JS, runs in-process, then pops
                                // back to the previous palette (used by
                                // the theme switcher to "apply + return")
```

`{ tmux }` is special: it dispatches *after* the popup closes, so interactive
tmux prompts (`confirm-before`, `command-prompt`) actually get keyboard
input. Without this, prompts hang because the popup still owns stdin.

## How it works (the trick)

The bash wrapper opens a `tmux display-popup` running the palette. When you
pick an item, the palette writes the encoded command to a tempfile and exits.
The wrapper *then* reads the tempfile and runs the command — *after* the
popup is gone. This matters because interactive tmux commands like
`confirm-before` need stdin, which is captured by the popup while it's open.
