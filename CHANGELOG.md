# Changelog

## v0.2.1 - 2026-05-14

- Fix: typing an auto-alias (e.g. `ns` for "New Session") now ranks the aliased item first instead of getting outranked by items that just happen to contain the query inside their category (e.g. "Detach" matching via "Sessio**ns**").

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-14

- Filter input now has a visible blinking caret, tinted with the active theme's accent (and retinted live as you scroll the theme picker).
- Cursor movement in the filter: Left/Right, Home/End (Ctrl+A/E), plus Alt+Left/Right and Ctrl+Left/Right for word jumps.
- Editing shortcuts in the filter: Backspace, Delete, Alt+Backspace/Ctrl+W for word-delete, Ctrl+U to kill-to-start, Ctrl+K to kill-to-end.
- Text selection with Shift + any of the cursor-movement keys (char, word, line ends). Typing replaces the selection; Backspace/Delete remove it; Esc clears it. Rendered with the theme's selected colors.
- README: noted beta status and contribution scope while the basics stabilize.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-05-13

- Fix: New Session command now switches you to the new session (was silently creating it in the background and leaving you on the current one).
- Fix: Wrapper script works on macOS's bash 3.2.
- Find Pane: cursor starts on the current pane; other panes render muted so the current one reads as the visual anchor.
